# Take Your Pic

A photo sharing app for polaroid lovers. Take your pic and add it to the gallery for all to see! Created using a React JavaScript frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.

A user can signup or login, take a picture of themselves and watch it develop through a CSS animation. They can then decide whether to retake or save their digital polaroid to the gallery. 

* Lazy Loading implemented to efficiently load only images in view. 
* Utilized JSON Web Tokens and localStorage to store encrypted user information client-side, providing user authentication.
* Developed a Rails API backend with endpoints for users and polaroids.
* Image upload functionality applied using activestorage.
